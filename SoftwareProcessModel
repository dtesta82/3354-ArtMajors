# Software Process Model: Prototyping

## Rationale

The prototyping software process model is ideal for project as a it enables our team to quickly determine initial objectives for each iteration of our project. Stakeholders are given a clear picture of what to expect from the project, and software engineers are able to outline the project requirements. Furthermore, as a user oriented application, feedback from alpha and beta testers for each prototype can be applied as each prototype is developed.

## Quick Startup

## Stakeholder Involvement
Development through series of prototypes allows stakeholders to detail what they expect developers to build.

## User Feedback
The prototyping model enables developers to quickly implement feedback from alpha and beta testers after each prototype is developed. In addition to testing application functionality, human machine interaction is evaluated at this step. Abstract concepts such as "feel" and "ease of use" are improved base on each iteration of user feedback.

## Alternative Models: Waterfall & Spiral
