# Non-Functional Requirements

## Product Requirements:
  Product Requirements: First, we need to consider the software efficiency for both performance and space. To analysis using which                               algorithm, and what is the running time and space. Because we don’t want the app to run too slow. Moreover, we                           need to consider for the software usability. Better usability makes user enjoy our app. And also, we want to                          provide a dependable app to our user. In our app, we might ask for user’s bank account information, and their                     personal information. Therefore, we need to make sure that our app is secure and will not leak the user’s information.
  
  Efficiency: For the efficiency part, we need to consider the speed of getting user data, the speed of user login, and the speed of                   sorting.
      Performance: To reduce the latency of the app, we need to increase the performance of the app. 
                   The App must be able to support both IOS and Android system. We not only need a clean and nice UI, but also need a fastand efficient software. 
                   Therefore, we need to consider the algorithm, its running time and space. 
      Space: User can set his or her maximum buffer for this app in the setting, once the buffer becomes full, the user can clean the                 buffer in order to make his or her phone perform faster. 

  Usability: App provided on Android and IOS.
             App must have a fluid, reactive design.
             
  Security: Constrain idle time, if a user is idle for too long the app closes.
  
  Performance: App shall not take more than 5 seconds to start up.
  
## Organizational:
  Environmental: we need to get user phone system’s permission of accessing different app such as uber eat, bank app and Apple health.                    Moreover, we need to know user’s location and credit card in order to know if user is saving money. 
  
  Operational: we need to get user phone system’s permission of accessing different app such as uber eat, bank app and Apple health.                    Moreover, we need to know user’s location and credit card in order to know if user is saving money. 
  
  Operational: Customer support on rewards/questions/complaints/etc.
               Reward retraction if customer claims a "charge-back".
               Users shall provide a PIN to the system for access to the app.
               
  Developmental:Consider which programming language and IDE is more suitable for developing the app. For instance, Java will be easier                   to write than C++, and IntelliJ is more clean and easy to use than NetBeans. 

               

## External:
 * Regulatory: 
 
 * Ethical: Maintain the integrity of the data. Keep data confidential and only accessible to the specific user.
 
 * Legislative: Information Privacy Law - System can not disclose or misuse information about private individuals no matter what. 
   * Accounting: 
   * Safety: The system must ask permissions from user in order for the system to take user purchases and activities from the user's              bank account.
             The user, at anytime, will be allowed to withdraw permissions from the system.
