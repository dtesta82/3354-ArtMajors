# Software Process Model: Prototyping

## Rationale

The prototyping software process model is ideal for project. It enables our team to quickly determine initial objectives by establishing clear goals in cooperation with both stake holders and developers. Stakeholders are given clear expectations regarding the immediate future of the project, and developer teams receive requirements for each prototype for quick implementation. Furthermore, as an user oriented application, we are able to quickly incorporate feedback from the testing phase as each prototype is developed.

## Quick Startup
One of the primary advantages of the prototype model is the "quick design" modeling phase. This process starts by determining the front end user experience, including interface layouts and output displays. This suits the needs of our Life Optimization app as it relies heavily on positive user experiences and ratings for success. Smooth user interface elements and navigation are crucial, especially when a complex background operations such as tracking user spending behaviors, predicting savings, and presenting that information makes keeping things readable a challenge.

## Stakeholder Involvement
The prototype model enables stakeholders to give continuous feedback on each prototype as they are developed. This helps establish a smooth user experience, as stakeholders may be focused less on technical details and more on execution and usability. In the case that implemented features don't perform as expected or prove to have better alternatives, communication with stakeholders allows goals to be shifted as needed.

## Drawbacks
The push for quick prototype development may lead to compromising proper programming practices for speed. As successive prototypes are created, these flaws can sometimes be overlooked. To deal with this, our team would likely take time off of the intensive prototyping process to refactor and clean up our code base if possible. This of course, depends on the success of our initial release.

## Alternative Models
Our team has also considered other potential models. However, they do not suit the needs of our project. The waterfall model is better in terms of ease of implementation, but emphasis extensive requirement documentation and lack of competition. Our team would not have time for this, and app store competition is on of our biggest challenges.

The spiral model is similar to prototyping, but includes risk assessment after each step. This step is useful for avoiding problems down the road. However, it is time consuming and requires risk assessment expertise that we, as a small team of developers, may not be able to afford.
